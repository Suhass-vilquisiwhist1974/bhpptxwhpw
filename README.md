Dude, just walked out of Cleaner with that dizzy aftertaste like when you stand up too fast after a deep nap. My shoes are sticking to the floor from god knows what was spilled, and there's this popcorn colonizing inside my jacket pocket. The theater was like a beehive of whispers and stray laughs, sort of like being in an open kitchen where the orders keep flying in—chaos, but beautiful chaos.

I mean, Cleaner! The whole thing is like, if you took a washing machine on a rollercoaster ride. Scenes tumbling after each other. That one part where the protagonist just paused in the doorway looking like she’d lost her keys and her mind simultaneously, I felt that hardcore. My back's still aching, like I worked a double shift and all I did was sit and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a screen. How bizarre is that, right?

> This guy, Robert something, walks around like he's trying to solve a Rubik's Cube with no colors. That eerie background score, like moths flapping against a lightbulb. Can't shake it off. Did they mean for it to be haunting or just quirky? Same diff, I guess, in the end. The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 swings between scenes like I'm flip-flopping between whether I'm gonna grill or sear the steak.

Oh, ya, someone was asking if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   – and honestly? Yes! 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with a plate of nachos that gets cold cause your eyes are glued, totally forgetting the cheese is solidifying. There's this bit where the camera zooms, and it felt like that time I burned my hand grabbing a hot pan – sudden and jarring.

It's not just about cleaning; it's like peeling an onion and finding a pearl inside or a garlic clove that turns out to be something else—don’t even ask me what. Mind's still reeling, like a frying pan that won't sit straight on the stovetop. I think I actually held my breath at one point and forgot how to exhale till the credits rolled.

Anyway, I should eat something proper now, or at least sweep out these crumbs somehow nestled everywhere. Let me know if you’re catching it, I'd say yes, a thousand times yes. Cleaner gets under the skin like a stubborn marinade.
